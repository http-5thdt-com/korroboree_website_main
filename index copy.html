                                 use
                                 this to mindfully parent and teach children.

                                 A year ago a journey called 'Moonshot Conversations' began on Facebook. Agnelorajesh and I
                                 believed that armed with moonshot thinking anything and everything is possible. These
                                 conversations explained the neuroscience and research on how the brain develops and why
                                 the
                                 brain's goals are not aligned with each one of us becoming the best versions of ourselves.
                                 The fact is that the brain has evolved to keep us alive and to survive; not to thrive.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 Each conversation spoke to parents and teachers on how we can hack the brain's goals and
                                 break away from disempowering thoughts, feelings and beliefs that don't allow us to live
                                 our
                                 best life. This time has taught us that we need less math, history and geography and more
                                 learning about how the brain works, how it can be motivated, and how to create neural
                                 circuitry that can help every individual to create the best version of themselves. We
                                 aspire
                                 for all children to grow up believing and knowing that anything and everything is
                                 possible.

                                 This time has taught us that what we are doing in schools is not going to cut it in the
                                 world
                                 of tomorrow and if we continue on this conventional education path <span

                                    best

                                 Once parents and teachers understand why some people stay stuck while others aspire, grow,
                                 persevere and find meaning, happiness and success they will change seeing their child’s
                                 potential as finite and begin to see it as infinite. We have all the tools you need for
                                 understanding this, and empowering your parenting and teaching, on Korroboree.

In 1991, she came to India on a year-long sabbatical from college. While connecting with her roots, she landed up taking a teaching stint at a prestigious heritage school in suburban Mumbai, an experience that changed her life and led to the burning question “How can she bring back the joy of childhood for the children in India?”</p>
                              
                              <p>
                                 Back then, the education system in India was still grappling with a straitjacketed approach to education. It was robbing children of their childhood. She was appalled by a lackluster system of education that upheld only the high-flyers. Crammed classrooms, disinterested students, and over-stressed parents inspired her to work on a model of education that was fulfilling, effective, and yet stress-free.

                              <p>
                                The conviction to offer an education that set the child at the centre, began with a preschool in Bandra (Mumbai) in the year 1993 with 25 students. With a successful formula at hand, she went from one preschool (Kangaroo Kids) to a network of them, whilst branching out to high schools (Billabong High International School) as well. The journey of developing child-centric schools across 44+ different cities in India and across Dubai, Maldives, and Qatar has been an outstanding one, supported by parents, education partners, and a fierce team of dedicated, passionate, and determined individuals at the school and central team level.

                              <p>
                                 In her endeavour to make a difference in every child’s life, she wrote her first book called ‘Who Do you Think You Are Kidding’. The book dealt with parenting for children and is a complete guide for parents on how to build a positive child right from the start. Teenage, as we all know, is the most difficult stage in life and the one where parents and children have the maximum amount of friction. Her second book ‘Drama Teen’, is a guide for both parents and teens.
